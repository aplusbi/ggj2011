EXTINCTION!

How to play
~~~~~~~~~~~
Place plants, herbivores, and carnivores in the world. They each behave according to their type:  
plants reproduce asexually, herbivores eat plants, carnivores eat herbivores. It costs currency
to place creatures in the world; you earn currency for as long as all three types exist in the world.
The game ends when all creatures go extinct!
